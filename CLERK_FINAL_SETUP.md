## 🔧 Final Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your Clerk Keys

1. Go to [https://dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Create a new application called "Crafty Kid"
3. Copy your keys from the API Keys section

### 2. Add to Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..." # Get this after creating webhook
```

### 3. Enable Google OAuth

In Clerk Dashboard:
1. Go to "User & Authentication" → "Social connections"
2. Toggle ON "Google"
3. Follow Google's setup if needed (usually works out of the box)

### 4. Set Up Webhook (Optional but Recommended)

In Clerk Dashboard:
1. Go to "Webhooks"
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/clerk/webhook`
3. Select events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
4. Copy the signing secret to `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 5. Run Database Migration

Since we added `clerkId` to the User model:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Add the clerkId column to your database
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "clerkId" TEXT UNIQUE;
```

## 🎯 Testing the Integration

1. **Start the dev server**: `npm run dev`

2. **Test Sign Up**:
   - Go to `/auth/sign-up`
   - Try signing up with Google
   - You should be redirected to `/dashboard`

3. **Test Admin Access**:
   - Sign in with latentsmurf@gmail.com or ladan.cher@gmail.com
   - You should see the admin dashboard

4. **Test Role-Based Redirects**:
   - `/dashboard` auto-redirects based on role
   - Protected routes require authentication

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling the Auth Pages

The Clerk components are already styled to match your theme. To customize further:

```typescript
// In sign-in/page.tsx or sign-up/page.tsx
<SignIn 
  appearance={{
    elements: {
      formButtonPrimary: "bg-primary hover:bg-primary/90",
      // Add more customizations
    },
  }}
/>
```

### Adding More OAuth Providers

In Clerk Dashboard:
- Enable GitHub, Twitter, Discord, etc.
- They'll automatically appear in the auth UI

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Admin Emails**: The admin emails are hardcoded for security
2. **Webhook Verification**: Always verify webhook signatures
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys

## 📝 Migration from Old Auth

- Old `/auth/login` → redirects to → `/auth/sign-in`
- Old `/auth/signup` → redirects to → `/auth/sign-up`
- Existing users need to reset their passwords via Clerk

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Clerk keys not found" error**:
- Make sure you added the keys to `.env.local`
- Restart the dev server after adding keys

**Google OAuth not working**:
- Check if Google is enabled in Clerk Dashboard
- For localhost, it should work without additional config

**Users not syncing to database**:
- Check webhook endpoint is correct
- Verify webhook secret is set
- Check webhook logs in Clerk Dashboard

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your app now has:
- Secure authentication with Clerk
- Google OAuth login
- Admin access for specified emails
- Role-based dashboards
