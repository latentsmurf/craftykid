# 🎉 Clerk is Set Up and Ready!

Your Clerk authentication is now configured with your API keys.

## ✅ What's Ready

1. **API Keys Configured** - Your Clerk keys are in `.env.local`
2. **Database Updated** - Prisma client generated with `clerkId` field
3. **Google OAuth** - Should be available on your sign-in page

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Restart your dev server** (if it's running):
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C) then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Authentication**:
   - Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth/sign-in
   - Try signing in with Google
   - Or create a new account

3. **Test Admin Access**:
   - Sign in with: latentsmurf@gmail.com or ladan.cher@gmail.com
   - You'll be redirected to the admin dashboard

## 🗄️ Database Migration

Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard to add the necessary columns:

```sql
-- Add clerkId column to User table for Clerk integration
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "clerkId" TEXT UNIQUE;

-- Add password column if it doesn't exist (for backward compatibility)
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "password" TEXT;
```

(The SQL is saved in `add-clerkid-column.sql`)

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

1. The sign-in page should show:
   - Google sign-in button
   - Email/password fields
   - "Sign up" link

2. After signing in:
   - Parents go to `/dashboard/parent`
   - Instructors go to `/dashboard/instructor`
   - Admins go to `/dashboard/admin`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"Application not configured" error**:
- Make sure you've enabled Google in Clerk Dashboard
- Go to: User & Authentication → Social connections → Toggle Google ON

**404 on sign-in page**:
- Make sure dev server is restarted
- Check that middleware.ts is in the root directory

**Not redirecting after sign in**:
- Clear cookies and try again
- Check browser console for errors
